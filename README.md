#PokeScanner


This is an old and outdated fork of the project.

PokeScanner was an application aimed at helping users locate Pokemon in their surrounding area. It was an open source effort with over 40 different contributors in 23 different languages with multiple features,but due to a request we had to stop development. A big thanks to everyone who supported the project, the devs, and all the translators.
